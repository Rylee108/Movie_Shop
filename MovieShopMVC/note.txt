MVC

Model : data representation for the view

View : HTML +CSS +JS +Razor

Controller:

HTTP requests:

GET / put/ post/ delete

GET http://movieshop.com/movies/details/2

controller name/action name/id as a parameter




You create entites based on requirement of databsae tables
you create models based on requireemnt of View


HomeController controller = new HomeController(new Logger(), new MovieService());
controller.Index();
Method(int x, IMovieService service);
Method(5, new MovieService() )
Partial Views are useful so that we can re use them across multiple views

EF Core - 6

Dapper -> micro-ORM - Northwind, Adven
ORM => Object Relation Mapper



EF  Core Code First approach

1. Install EF Core tools 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef

2. Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer in Infra and MVC projects
3. Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design in MVC
4. Create a class inherits from DbContext => represents your Database
5. Create a connection string which EF Core is going to use to access the database
    should include server name, Database Name and any credentials
6. Read the connection string from appsettings.json and inject into MovieShopDbContext
7. DbSet represents your database table, create an entity class that represents your table
8. Migrations - Create Initial Migration dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration  -p ../Infrastructure/Infrastructure.csproj
9. Apply the Migration dotnet ef database update
10. TO make any schema changes, we can use 2 approaches
    1. Data Annotations => using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
    2. Fluent API => much more powerful and has more options

Reguster => email/password

1.public access => home page, movie details page, cast details, login, register
2.customer access (loged in) => view/edit profile, purchase movie, review/rating, favorite
3. Admin Access (User loged in and have role of admin)=> create movie, creat cast, get most purchased movie

   Register                     
    email                   password          Salt
 u1 abc@abc.com             (Pas##4HKLtt   +  adfafafdafdaf)        Hashing  -Pdbk/Bcrypt => dakhfkjdadhf769as7f90adufadnfn
 u2 xyz@abc.com             (Pas##4HKLtt   +  hfhhgdhgdfhggds)



 Login
 u1 abc@abc.com
